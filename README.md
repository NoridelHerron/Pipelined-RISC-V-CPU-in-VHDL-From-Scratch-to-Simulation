# Pipelined-RISC-V-CPU-in-VHDL-From-Scratch-to-Simulation
This project is a fully custom, 5-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU designed and implemented in VHDL. It was built from scratch, stage by stage, with modular structure and thorough testing. Each pipeline stage—IF, ID, EX, MEM, and WB—was verified independently to ensure signal correctness and data consistency.
